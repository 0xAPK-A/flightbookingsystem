UPDATED:
3. Revised Database Design (High-Level)
Tables to Consider
Users Table:
As previously designed.

Aircraft Table:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE aircraft (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    tail_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    model VARCHAR(50),
    seating_capacity INT,
    status VARCHAR(20) CHECK (status IN ('active', 'maintenance', 'decommissioned')) DEFAULT 'active'
);
Flight Segments Table:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE flight_segments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    flight_number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    airline VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    departure_airport VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    arrival_airport VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    departure_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    arrival_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    available_seats INT NOT NULL,
    aircraft_id INT REFERENCES aircraft(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Itineraries Table:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE itineraries (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    total_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    total_duration INTERVAL,
    booked_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Itinerary_Segments Table:

This table maps itineraries to the flight segments included.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE itinerary_segments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    itinerary_id INT REFERENCES itineraries(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    segment_id INT REFERENCES flight_segments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    sequence_no INT,  -- Order of the segment in the itinerary
    layover_duration INTERVAL  -- Calculated layover time before next flight
);
Bookings Table:
Could be linked to itineraries.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE bookings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    itinerary_id INT REFERENCES itineraries(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    booking_status VARCHAR(20) CHECK (booking_status IN ('confirmed', 'cancelled')) DEFAULT 'confirmed',
    booked_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Payments Table:
As previously designed.

Airports Table:
For extended airport data if needed.

4. Use Cases and Error Handling
Use Case: Booking a Connecting Flight
Search:

User enters origin and destination with a date.

System searches flight segments and suggests itineraries (combining segments if needed).

Selection:

User selects an itinerary.

System checks availability on all segments.

Booking:

On booking, system reserves seats on each segment using transactions.

If any segment fails (e.g., not enough seats), the transaction is rolled back.

Payment:

Payment is processed, and booking status is updated.

Confirmation:

Confirmation is sent to the user.

Error Handling:
Seat Availability Error:

If any segment is overbooked, return a clear error and prompt the user to choose a different itinerary.

Transaction Failure:

Ensure that the booking process is atomic (using database transactions). If any step fails, all changes are reverted.

Connectivity Issues:

Use retries and circuit breakers in API calls to external payment and notification services.

Validation Errors:

Input data must be validated both on the client and server sides.

Admin Use Case: Managing Aircraft
Dashboard:

Admin sees a list of aircraft, their statuses, and maintenance schedules.

Aircraft Assignment:

Admin can reassign an aircraft if one goes into maintenance.

Notifications:

Alerts for overdue maintenance or decommissioned aircraft.

5. Testing and Quality Assurance
Test Cases
Unit Tests:

Test each model’s business logic (e.g., verifying seat availability).

Validate utility functions and API controllers.

Integration Tests:

Simulate the complete booking flow with multiple segments.

Test database transactions and rollback scenarios.

Load Testing:

Use tools (e.g., k6 or JMeter) to simulate high traffic and concurrent bookings.

Security Testing:

Ensure endpoints are protected against SQL injection, XSS, and other vulnerabilities.

Edge Cases:

Booking with minimal layover times.

Attempting to book when one segment is full.

Admin reassigning an aircraft mid-flight (simulate conflict).

6. Conclusion
For a production-ready flight management system, you should:

Separate flight segments from itineraries to support connecting flights.

Include an aircraft table for managing fleet operations and aircraft availability.

Design comprehensive error handling and transactional booking processes.

Plan for extensive testing and load management.
